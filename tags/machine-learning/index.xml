      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve started (again) a course of Machine Learning on Coursera. These are some notes about the course.
Machine Learning problems can be seperated into two major parts: Supervised and Unsupervised machine learning.
Supervised machine learning is when we have some right answers for some amount of inputs and want to predict right anwsers for different inputs.
In Unsupervised machine learning programs we does not have any right anwsers it makes clastering of data.</description>
