<p>I&rsquo;ve started this company with my friends. The position may be confusing, I was the CTO of the company and the only technical person during the first year.</p>

<p>After a year we managed to get first developer and my responsibilities changed a bit. But till this day I do code reviews, work with development team closely on defining task and deciding right technical solutions.</p>

<h4 id="at-itdc-i-gained-most-of-my-experience">At ITDC I gained most of my experience</h4>

<p>As you can see I&rsquo;ve spent 10 years working at ITDC. When I started team was just 5-6 people (including founders). In 10 years company had grown to have more than 60 employees and I consider myself as one of the key employees who help the company grow.</p>

<p>At ITDC we had lots of different types of web projects, starting from a small blog up to portal for the parliament of Georgia, or all the websites of embassies of Georgia in different countries.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve build LMS (Learning Management System) for one of the biggest universities in Georgia. This project was a big step for me at the time (2007-2008). I did not have experience of managing and developing such system and I learned a lot.</p>

<p>We had two major development departments in the company. One of them was lead by me. We mostly worked on external projects and provided with different solutions for different problems. We built CMS for our needs. At first it was built on CodeIgniter framework, but after Laravel gained some traction we moved to Laravel.</p>

<p>In ITDC I did lots of experiments, I&rsquo;ve tried different tools and techniques, some of them were successful some were not, but either way I learned a lot.</p>

<p>Here I started to sharing the knowledge by establishing ITDC Training Center and it was one of our major sources for finding new developers. The idea and the execution of the training center was mine and it was quite successful.</p>
